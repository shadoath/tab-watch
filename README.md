# TabWatch

> See how long every browser tab has been open — search, sort, jump to or close any tab without leaving the popup.

## Features

### Core

- **Time per tab** — tracks how long each tab has been open, persisted across browser sessions
- **Sort by duration or title** — click column headers to toggle sort direction (↑ ↓)
- **Search** — filter tabs by title or URL instantly
- **Jump to tab** — click any row to focus that tab and window, closing the popup
- **Close tab** — hover a row to reveal an × button; closes the tab without switching to it
- **Visit counter** — tracks how many times you've activated each tab; persists even after the tab is closed and reopened
- **Dark / light mode** — toggle in the toolbar or settings, preference saved automatically

### Settings

All configurable via the ⚙ settings page:

- **Badge count** — shows the number of open tabs on the extension icon
- **Tab groups** — displays each tab's Chrome group name and color as a pill
- **Tab limit warning** — dims tabs open longer than a configurable threshold (default 7 days)
- **Auto-refresh** — keeps durations updating live while the popup is open; interval: 1s / 3s / 5s / 10s
- **Animations** — subtle fade-in cascade when the popup opens
- **Clear tab history** — wipe all stored open-time and visit data

## How it works

- A background service worker listens for `tabs.onUpdated` events. When a page finishes loading it stores `tabId + URL → timestamp` in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Visit counts are stored by URL so they survive a tab being closed and reopened.
- When you open the popup, it reads all open tabs, fetches stored timestamps, and calculates elapsed time.
- Navigating to a new URL in a tab resets that tab's timer. Refreshing the same page does not.
- The auto-refresh ticker updates duration text in-place (no DOM rebuild) to avoid flicker.
- Stale timestamp keys for tabs that no longer exist are cleaned up on browser startup.

All data is stored locally in your browser. Nothing is ever sent anywhere.

## Why this exists

I built this because I'm a habitual tab hoarder — tabs I open with the intention of reading, acting on, or coming back to just... sit there. Days turn into weeks. TabWatch makes the problem visible: when you can see that a tab has been open for 42 days, it's a lot harder to ignore. The tab limit warning dims the worst offenders so they stand out immediately. Open it, deal with it, close it.
